## AutoClickWizard Future Updates

As the main developer behind AutoClickWizard, I am committed to enhancing and expanding its functionality to provide you with an improved user experience. Here are some exciting features and improvements I plan to implement in future updates:

### Click Point Recording

In an upcoming update, we will introduce the ability to record and save specific click points on your screen. This feature will make it easier to automate tasks that involve interacting with specific elements or locations. Here's what you can expect:

- **Record Click Points**: Simply click anywhere on your screen to record the coordinates of the click.
- **Save and Name Click Sets**: You can save the recorded click points and give them meaningful names for easy reference.
- **Edit and Delete**: Optionally, you'll be able to edit or delete recorded click points as needed.
- **Execute Recorded Clicks**: Run the saved click point sets to automate your tasks efficiently.

### Persistent UI

- **System Tray Icon**: I will introduce a system tray (or taskbar) icon will allow you to minimize the main window while keeping the program running in the background.
- **Access from System Tray**: By clicking the system tray icon, users will be able to swiftly access and interact with the program's UI. Furthermore, a "Persistent Window" mode will be implemented to ensure your UI remains prominently visible regardless of other open windows or tasks.
