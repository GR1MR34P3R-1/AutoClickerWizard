## About

Hey there, welcome to AutoClickWizard â€“ your trusty Python-driven auto-clicker. Wave goodbye to the dull grind of repetitive chores and dive into a world of super-smooth efficiency.

## Features

- **Intuitive GUI**: A user-friendly graphical user interface makes it easy to configure auto-clicking settings.

- **Customizable Clicking**: Set the click interval (in seconds) and specify the number of clicks you want to perform, giving you full control over the automation process.

- **Custom Coordinates**: Enable custom coordinates to click precisely where you want on the screen. Specify X and Y values to automate clicks in specific locations.

- **Fail-Safe Mechanism**: A built-in fail-safe mechanism monitors cursor position and triggers an emergency stop if the cursor approaches screen edges, ensuring safe and reliable auto-clicking.

- **Mouse Cursor Return**: If the mouse cursor moves during auto-clicking, the program automatically returns it to its original position, maintaining precision and accuracy.

- **Hotkeys**: Utilize convenient hotkeys for quick and easy control. Start auto-clicking with the `;` key, stop it with the `,` key, and trigger an immediate emergency stop with the `Esc` key.

- **Event Logging**: The program logs events and errors, helping with troubleshooting and providing a record of auto-clicking activities.

- <ins>**V2.0.0 (9/30/2023):**</ins>

- **Input Validation:** Added input validation for the CPS (Clicks Per Second) and the number of clicks to ensure valid inputs.

- **Custom Coordinates Validation:** Implemented validation for custom X and Y coordinates when in custom mode, ensuring coordinates are within the screen boundaries.

- **Program State Management:** Introduced the `program_running` variable to track whether the auto-clicking program is running, preventing you from starting it when it's already running and handling the "Panic Button" appropriately.

- **Thread Handling:** Added error handling for thread execution when starting auto-clicking, displaying error messages for thread-related issues and terminating the thread if it doesn't stop gracefully.

- **Hotkey Registration Error Handling:** Provided error handling for registering hotkeys to help you understand if hotkeys could not be registered.
